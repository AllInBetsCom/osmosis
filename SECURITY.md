# Osmosis Bug Reporting and Feature Requests

Osmosis uses GitHub to manage feature requests and bugs for its platform. This is done via GitHub Issues.

## Feature Request

For a feature request, please [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/new). Clearly state your use case and what value it will bring to other users or developers on Osmosis.

If it is something that can be handled by a parameter change, we encourage you to join the Osmosis Commonwealth Forum for discussions. You can participate in the forum by visiting https://gov.osmosis.zone/overview. Additionally, you can also join the Osmosis Discord community at https://discord.com/invite/osmosis and engage in the #governance-proposals channel to discuss and consider governance proposals.

## Standard Priority Bug

For a bug that is non-sensitive and/or operational in nature rather than a critical vulnerability, please add it as a GitHub issue.

If it is not triaged in a couple of days, feel free to tag @p0mvn, @czarcas7ic, @mattverse, @daniel-farina, @ValarDragon

## Critical Bug or Security Issue

If you're here because you're trying to figure out how to notify us of a security issue, please send us a message on https://security.osmosis.zone/ or via [Telegram](https://t.me/OsmoSec) 

Please avoid opening public issues on GitHub that contain information about a potential security vulnerability as this makes it difficult to reduce the impact and harm of valid security issues.

### Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We ask security researchers to keep vulnerabilities and communications around vulnerability submissions private and confidential until a patch is developed. In addition to this, we ask that you:

- Allow us a reasonable amount of time to correct or address security vulnerabilities.
- Avoid exploiting any vulnerabilities that you discover.
- Demonstrate good faith by not disrupting or degrading Osmosis's services.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

1. **Report:** Report the vulnerability by sending a message to https://security.osmosis.zone/
2. **Verification:** Our team verifies the issue and prepares a patch for eligible releases.
3. **Notification:** We notify the community of the upcoming security release to give users time to prepare their systems.
4. **Fix deployment:** The fixes are applied publicly, and new releases are issued once the community is ready.
5. **Bug bounty reward:** We pay out bug bounties to submitters if applicable.

Please keep vulnerability submissions private and confidential until a patch is developed. Allow us a reasonable amount of time to correct or address vulnerabilities and avoid exploiting any vulnerabilities that you discover.

Thank you for helping us keep Osmosis and its users safe and secure.
